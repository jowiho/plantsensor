# My scratch pad for experiments with the TTGO HiGrow

## Useful links
* Vendor firmware: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-HiGrow/
* Home assistant integration discussion: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/ttgo-higrow-with-esphome/144053

## Notes
* Temperature sensor always seems to return a too high value. Possibly picking up heat from the board?
* BME280 altitude is useless for a static plant sensor
* Salt sensor is pretty useless
